# Book-Management-System

***Note: You need to create a .env file with the MYSQL_DB_BOOK_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM=<mysql_db_connection_url_as_string> environment variable in the current folder.***

# How to run the program:

1. Create schema and table by running the sql script found in the **sql script** folder in your MySQL Workbench (connection credentials of the database and inside the **.env** file must match).
2. Run the **main.exe** file.
3. Import Postman collections from the **tests** folder to test out each API endpoint.
